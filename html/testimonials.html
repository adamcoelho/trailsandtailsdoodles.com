I decided I needed a dog on a Tuesday, found Diane that day and had put down a deposit by Saturday. Within the next week Diane FaceTimed me and I picked out the little puppy Charlie. She is quite possibly one of the happiest puppies in Missoula, and she loves every human and dog she comes along. Charlie has quite the personality, you can tell she's smart but there is always a little sass present, but I wouldn't have it any other way. At least once a week I have people asking me what breeder she's from because they want their own Charlie.&rdquo;</span>

              <span class="d-block mt-3 mt-md-4 lead text-white text-justify">&ldquo;We are beyond grateful that our search for a red, mini Goldendoodle led us to Diane and Tails &amp; Trials Doodles! Our Idaho-born Spud has completed our family. He is smart, spunky, affectionate, playful, loyal and quick to learn - in short, everything one would want in a dog. Since his grandparents met up with Diane at the Boise airport to bring him home to us in California, Spud truly has been the "toast of the town". He loves meeting new people and dogs alike (and of all ages). It was the testimonials from other owners of Diane's pups that first tugged at our hearts, and we can only echo those glowing comments in describing our experience working with her. Diane is an absolute gem, just like her gorgeous dogs. The care and love she bestows on them before they go to their forever homes was evident in all of our communications with her, and certainly in how our Spud has behaved since joining us. In short, he has adapted seamlessly to life in our home, from his very first night here. He took to his crate immediately, has no issues being cuddled vigorously (especially by our 5 year-old), loves his baths, and is a hearty eater. Thank you so much, Diane, for bringing our "sweet potato" into our lives!&rdquo;</span>

              <span class="d-block mt-3 mt-md-4 lead text-justify">&ldquo;Cash has been an absolute delight to me and my whole family. He provides constant entertainment and is a source of pure joy! Diane provided some really good reading material, before I picked up my puppy and it has been so valuable in the training process! He is a super smart puppy, so training him has been easy. He was crate trained in 3 very easy days and in 4 weeks he is potty trained as well. I can count on one hand the number of accidents he had during his potty training and if there was an accident it was usually because I let him go too long between visits to the yard - my fault. Diane is a very responsible and ethical breeder and loves her dogs and puppies and its reflected in their dispositions, blood lines and intelligence. When you get a puppy from Diane the training has already started, as well as exceptional love and care. Diane continues to be a source of support and very valuable information well after I picked up my sweet Cash. I am thrilled with my new little family member and can't say enough about Diane as a breeder - she is fabulous!&rdquo;</span>

She has been phenomenal with absolutely everything. We loved how she posted weekly videos of the puppies. Which allowed us to be able to see and watch the puppies grow. It was something we looked forward every Monday. She was extremely informative and punctual. Any questions we had, she would always respond quickly. I love how she sincerely cares where the puppies are going home to and she is so genuine and very kind. We came from Seattle, WA and drove all the way there to pick and choose the puppy. It definitely was worth the drive. Ollie has made our home feel so complete and has brought us so much joy. We don't know how we have been without him all this time. Ollie is so playful, friendly and well loved. He brings us so much light and love to our lives and we absolutely adore him. We can not thank Diane enough for giving us the opportunity to get one of her puppies. She is so amazing and so knowledgeable. We feel so blessed to have a new addition to our family and see our family grow.&rdquo;</span>

From start to finish, purchasing a puppy from Diane Hawkes, owner of Trails &amp; Tails Doodles, was a pleasure. Diane is a delightful person who is extremely knowledgeable about puppies and puppy care. I had many questions throughout this transaction to purchase a puppy. Diane took the time to answer my emails or personally call me to talk through any concerns and questions I had. Our new puppy, Annie, is a healthy, energetic and happy little pup. She is very smart, observant and is learning very quickly. Annie is playful with our four year old Lhasapoo, Max and is the perfect addition to our family. I would recommend, without reservation, buying a puppy from Diane at Trails and Tails Doodles.&rdquo;</span>

The process began with Diane getting to know us and searching for the right puppy to fit in our family. Previously we had been Basset Hound owners so Diane spent time educating us about Doodles and what to expect. She is very knowledgeable about this breed and takes pride in her program. Diane also communicates along the way, and as others have said, even after our precious pup Bowie came home. Video day (the weekly video posted of the puppies' growth and activities) was much anticipated. The puppy picking day - how exciting and fun that was! We Skyped with Diane as we viewed all those adorable puppies and she gave us her thoughts on puppy personalities. Bowie is a great addition to our family and our granddaughters have had zero allergy symptoms while spending time with us! We highly recommend Trails &amp; Tails Doodles if you are looking for the total package and we have made a friend in Diane as an added blessing!&rdquo;</span>

Like others have mentioned, Diane was extremely communicative (both before and after purchase) she helped with questions we had as first time puppy owners. Our Nola was quick to learn to sit and shake! Nola is very friendly and far from a guard dog! She welcomes anyone that is in her company! Nola is almost a year old and weighs about 25lbs. Nola is very social and loves to play. We could not have asked for a better puppy... Thank you again for everything Diane! We love Nola!&rdquo;</span>

He is sweet, smart, and the perfect addition to our family. We have gone through this process several times in our lives, but working with Diane at Trails and Tails was an absolute pleasure. It is rare to find someone in this business who wants to talk to you on the phone, answer questions, and communicate as readily as Diane does. We knew this was the right fit the first time we spoke with her on the phone, and this was reinforced throughout the entire process. Even after we took him home we got text messages making sure we were doing ok and tips for training and settling in. We were able to view the puppies each week via the fantastic videos that Diane does, and also able to visit the puppies a few times before bringing Finn home. This made all the difference in feeling like we were getting the perfect fit for our family. Our little guy's color, size and temperament have all developed just as Diane said they would, and we could not be more steadfast in our recommendation for working with Diane to find the perfect goldendoodle to anyone looking for a new family member. Thank you Diane for the amazing Finn and the dedication you have to ensuring these little creatures find their forever families.&rdquo;</span>

After emailing Diane and asking for more information about Ginger's litter we talked on the phone for a while. I felt a real connection with her. I liked the fact that she was really trying to make sure her puppies were a good fit and were going to good homes. She kept us informed about the pups weekly. I looked forward to Movie Mondays :). Our puppy Scarlett, has been such a wonderful addition to our family. Scarlett is sweet, beautiful and smart. Thanks again for all that you did when answering questions from the beginning. You made the process very simple. We will definitely want another doodle from you in the future. Thank you so so much!&rdquo;</span>

I had the pleasure of talking with Diane and sharing with her what I was looking for in a puppy. I was able to view a you tube video showcasing her doodles and I instantly fell in love with them. Diane was very knowledgeable with the Goldendoodle breed and answered all of my questions. I also was able to reach her on a daily basis with any of my concerns or questions. I was very happy to hear she breeds for temperment, obtained genetic testing and health screenings as that was of major importance to me. She truly loves and has so much compassion for the Goldendoodle breed and it definitely shows in her puppies. Once I chose my puppy I opted to meet Diane in Idaho to pick her up. Diane made everything so easy and stress free for me. I would highly recommend Trails and Tails if your looking for a reputable breeder that specializes in quality puppies and quality service.&rdquo;</span>

We feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with Diane at Trails &amp; Tails Doodles. We didn't get just any dog, and we didn't just work with any breeder. Diane is so amazing with her kind and loving relationship she has with families and her dogs. She truly wants what you want, a good home and and extra special dog. Our Ruby has done a lot of traveling and camping from the time we got her. She travels well and even at an early age did well with potty training. We have two children who adore her, and they all play well together. Ruby is a mellow puppy. We get compliments all the time on her behavior and her sweet demeanor. When I read the other testimonials, I feel the same as others do. I would highly recommend Trails &amp; Tails Doodles. You would know your dog was loved as much as you do! Thanks Diane for helping us find who was missing in our family, Ruby!&rdquo;</span>

A deal fell through with a breeder in Utah and we had looked and looked in Idaho for a breeder that had the mini size and dark red color that we wanted but just couldn't seem to find them anywhere! With a prayer and one last google search we found him! He was the last little male available and he is absolutely perfect! He is so fluffy, has a great appetite, and has been so easy to train! I had a ton of questions and we wanted to come and see him before we brought him home and Diane was open to all of it! Making our family feel so welcome and always going above and beyond giving training advice, texting us to see how we have been doing, all the way down to the little tag on his take home bag that said &ldquo;little boy white I hope you have a good life&rdquo;! She truly cares about her puppies and their parents and made our experience with her great! We would highly recommend her and her puppies! Thank you so much for our little Nash! He is truly going to be treasured.&rdquo;</span>

She was extremely communicative (both before and after purchase), very thorough and most important - you could really tell she cares about her animals. She would post videos, pictures, and send us updates regularly and when it was time to ship our puppy from Idaho to California she took care of everything. As you can tell by browsing the website, this is NOT a puppy mill. These are some very special puppies, cared for with plenty of love right in Diane's very own backyard. Our Finnegan fit perfectly into our existing family, and absolutely adores all of our children, including our 11 year old Labrador named Bailey. He's EXTREMELY intelligent, well-mannered, and healthy. He learned to sit, shake, stay and lay down in just a few hours - it was amazing! He's now just over 8 months old, weighs in at 60+ pounds and is super social and active. We could not have asked for a better dog... Thank you for everything Diane!&rdquo;</span>

He was responding to "sit" on day one, and he has not had one "accident" inside. And the real miracle...he doesn't request to go outside during the night. Such an easy puppy to train, and so eager to please. And did I mention...after many golden retrievers...NO FUR BALLS rolling around the house and NO HAIR clinging to my black pants! We would recommend Trails &amp; Tails Doodles to anyone and everyone looking for a sweet, loveable goldendoodle. Happy Trails &amp; Tails to you!&rdquo;</span>

Her website immediately caught my eye because I loved all of the video updates and info she provided about the puppies. We initially were searching for breeders around our home in Northern CA, but as I read up more and more about how vital the first 12 weeks are to a puppy's personality and temperament, we knew we wanted a breeder who was loving and nurturing to our puppy since most of those first 12 weeks would be spent with her. We found that with Diane. She was willing to provide us a lot of initial information and continuing support, she answered all of our questions, and I just felt the environment the puppies are raised in at her home is so warm and positive. When we met to get our little Cheddar, she provided me with some basic supplies and information for our pup and as soon as I saw him, I just knew we made the right choice. He is so playful and loving and incredibly smart. All of our friends just can't believe what a good dog he is and he takes to training very well. We are just loving having him in our lives and are grateful to Diane for her care of our sweet boy!&rdquo;</span>

We loved that you did movie Mondays and even though we purchased our puppy last minute, it was fun to go back through your videos and see the puppies grow. The puppy care tips on your website have been very helpful and the dog training book you gave us has been a great read. We have felt very supported by you throughout this process, both before we picked up our puppy and after as we raise her.

I had been researching Goldendoodles and breeders online for the past two years...trying to find someone reputable and trustworthy to provide me with the puppy of my dreams. When I came across your website and saw pictures of the quality dogs you breed, I was thrilled to discover you had a litter of mini reds that were just born. I knew it was meant to be and I can honestly say it was one of those times when "you just know." From the minute my family picked her up to bring her to me in CA, she has been nothing but happy, confident, and well behaved. Miss Daisy is the perfect puppy! Everyone who meets her falls in love with her great disposition and wonderful temperament. Who knew an 8 week old puppy could be so good?! I will send you periodic updates and pictures of Daisy and I as we navigate through her puppyhood and adult years. She and I start Kinder-Puppy classes next month, and I am confident she will be at the top of her class. I could not have asked for a better dog. Thanks again, Diane.

Diane took a lot of time educating us about the process and making sure Monty was the right fit. She has gone above and beyond as a breeder making sure he is being well taken care of in his new home, even months after he’s been home. Monty is so smart! He’s never had any accidents in his crate ever and he’s the sweetest pup. We drove from Boise to Seattle to take Monty home and he was an angel in the car the whole car ride. I continue to recommend Diane to anyone looking for a doodle and if we do ever get a second pup we’ll for sure be going back to Trails &amp; Tails Doodles.&rdquo;</span>
